Points, Vectors and Normals

  1 - Points represents a position;
  2 - Vectors represents a direction;
  3 - Normals are perpendicular to the plane tangent a P(Point). 
  4 - All then can be represented by n-Vectors. 
  
Points and vectors can be transformed using linear transformations.
 
  1 - Translation for Points;
  2 - Rotation for Vector.
  
The length o the Vector can be set to 1, in which case we say that it is normalised.

Coordinates system (x, y and z).

||V|| = sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z) length, norm or magnitude (Is like h2 = c2 + c2, but 3d space)
|| indicates the length of vector

Normalized vectors

The mathematical notation is:

^V = V / ||V|| 

Normalized vector = vector / length of vector
