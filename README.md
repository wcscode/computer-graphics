Points, Vectors and Normals

  1 - Points represents a position;
  2 - Vectors represents a direction;
  3 - Normals are perpendicular to the plane tangent a P(Point). 
  4 - All then can be represented by n-Vectors. 
  
 Points and vectors can be transformed using linear transformations.
 
  1 - Translation for Points;
  2 - Rotation for Vector.
  
 The length o the Vector can be set to 1, in which case we say that it is normalised.
